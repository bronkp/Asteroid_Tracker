<h1>Asteroid Forecast</h1>
<p>Asteroid Forecast creates infographics about notable near earth objects for the coming seven days.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Daily, using Nasa's Near Earth Object Webservice, this program takes in all the near earth objects over the next seven days. Then the biggest, fastest, and closest objects are identified and added to a Vercel Edge Store. Users then get infographics generated based on the data provided by the Edge Store that help in the understanding of these cosmic scales. The backend employs Express.js and is hosted using Vercel.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p> Space is BIG, bigger than our minds can understand. I wanted to create a project that dynamically can express the scales of space and luckily Nasa had an api for just that. Asteroids make a perfect medium for exploring scales as they are countless and vary quite a lot. Often when checking in you may see an asteroid of 10,000 feet in diameter will pass by earth at 40,000 miles per hour (though at a distance probably several jupiters away).</p>
